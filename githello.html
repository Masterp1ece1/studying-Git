Git is used in most companies where a project has at least two developers:
<ol>
<li>A new person joins the company and clones the project repository on the desktop.</li>
<li>Receives a task, creates a new branch, and writes code.</li>
<li>When everything is ready, submits a pull request to the master branch:</li>
<li>Other developers review the code, leave comments, and point out errors.</li>
<li>The new person refines the code, updates the master branch, and moves on to the next task.</li>
</ol>
